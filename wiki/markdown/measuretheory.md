## Definitions

-------

_Def_: A collection $\mathcal M$ of a set $X$ is said to be a $\sigma$**-algebra** in $X$ if $\mathcal X$ satisfies the following properties:

1. $X \in \mathcal M$;
2. if $E \in \mathcal M$, then $X \setminus E = E^c = \in \mathcal M$; 
3. if $E = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty E_n$ and $E_n \in \mathcal M$ for each $n$, then $E \in \mathcal M$.

Then, we call $X$ a **measurable space** and elements of $\mathcal M$ **measurable sets**.

_Def_: Take two measurable spaces $X$ and $Y$ with $\sigma$-algebras $\mathcal M_X, \mathcal M_Y$. Then, $f: X \to Y$ is said to be **measurable** if $f^{-1}(E) \in \mathcal M_X$ for all $E \in \mathcal M_Y$.

_Def_: Take a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal M$ on $X$. A **positive measure** (or simply a measure) is a function $\mu: \mathcal M \to [0, \infty]$ which is countably additive, i.e. satisfies
$$\mu \left( \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty E_n \right) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(E_n)$$
for disjoint sets $\{E_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$.
Then, we say that a **measure space** is a measurable space with a corresponding positive measure, and we write it often as a triple $(X, \mathcal M, \mu)$. Moreover, if the codomain of $\mu$ is $\R$ or $\C$, we say that it is a **signed** measure or a **complex** measure respectively. Finally, if $\mu(X) = 1$, then we say that $\mu$ is a **probability** measure.

_Def_: A simple function is a function whose image has only finitely many points.

_Def_: For a measurable function $f: X \to Y$ between measurable spaces $(X, \mathcal M_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal M_Y)$, we say that the $\sigma$**-algebra generated by** $f$ is
$$\sigma(f) = \{f^{-1}(S) \mid S \in \mathcal M_Y\}.$$

_Def_: For a measure space $(X, \mathcal M, \mu)$, define $L^p(\mu)$ to be all measurable functions $f$ on $X$ for which
$$\left(\int_X |f|^p d\mu\right)^{1/p} < \infty.$$

## Basic Properties of Measures

-------

**Prop (Continuity of Measure)**: Let $\{E_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ be an ascending sequence of sets, i.e. $E_1 \subset E_2 \subset \dots$. Then, we have that 
$$\mu \left( \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty E_n \right) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \mu(E_n).$$
Similarly, if $\{E_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is a descending sequence of sets, i.e. $E_1 \supset E_2 \supset \dots$. Then, 
$$\mu \left( \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty E_n \right) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \mu(E_n)$$
as well.

_Proof_: For the ascending sequence, put $A_1 = E_1$ and $A_n = E_n \setminus E_{n-1}$ for $n \geq 2$; then we have that
$$\mu(E_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n \mu(A_i) \text{ and } \mu(E) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \mu(A_n)$$
which immediately gives us what we want.

**Corollary (Subadditivity of Measure)**: For $\{E_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$, we have that
$$\mu \left( \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty E_n \right) \leq \sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(E_n).$$

In the other case, simply put $A_n = E_1 \setminus E_n$, so that the previous part gives us
$$\mu(E_1) - \mu \left( \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty E_n \right) = \mu \left( E_1 - \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty E_n \right) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \mu(A_n) = \mu(E_1) - \lim_{n \to \infty} \mu(E_n) $$
which then gives us what we want as well. $\square$

**Prop**: Let $(X, \mathcal M)$ be a measurable space. If $f: X \to [-\infty, \infty]$ satisfies that $f^{-1}((\alpha, \infty]) \in \mathcal M$ for every real $\alpha$, then $f$ is measurable.

_Proof_: TODO

**Lemma**: If $f_n: X \to [-\infty, \infty]$ is measurable for $n \geq 1$, and
$$g = \sup_n f_n \text{ and } h = \limsup_{n \to \infty} f_n,$$
then $g, h$ are measurable.

_Proof_: We have that
$$g^{-1}((\alpha, \infty]) = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty f_n^{-1}((\alpha, \infty])$$
so $g$ is measurable, and
$$h = \inf_{m \geq 1} \left\{ \sup_{n \geq m} f_n \right\}$$
as therefore also measurable.

## Lebesgue Integration

-------

**Prop**: Let $f: X \to [0, \infty]$ be measurable. Then there are simple measurable functions $s_n$ on $X$ such that

1. $0 \leq s_1 \leq s_2 \leq \cdots \leq f$ and 
2. $s_n(x) \to f(x)$ as $n \to \infty$ pointwise on $X$.

_Proof_: Take $\delta_n = 2^{-n}$; for each positive integer $n$ and real number $t$, we can find integer $k_{n,t}$ such that $k_{n,t}\delta_n < (k+1)\delta_n$. Then, define
$$\phi_n(t) = \begin{cases} k_{n,t}\delta_n & 0\leq t < n \\ n & n \leq t \leq \infty \end{cases}$$
so that we have 

1. $t - \delta_n < \phi_n(t) \leq t$ for all $0 \leq t \leq n$,
2. $0 \leq \phi_1 \leq \phi_2 \leq \cdots \leq t$, 
3. and $\phi_n(t) \to t$ as $n \to \infty$.

Then, letting $s_n = \phi_n \circ f$ clearly does the job. $\square$

_Def_: If $s: X \to [0, \infty)$ is a measurable simple function, given by 
$$s = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i 1_{A_i}$$
and if $E \in \mathcal M$, we set
$$\int_E s d\mu = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i \mu(A_i \cap E).$$
Then, for any measurable $f: X \to [0, \infty]$, we have
$$\int_E f d\mu = \sup_s \int_E s d\mu$$
where the supremum is overall simple measurable functions less than $f$. Finally, for $f: X \to [-\infty, \infty]$, we let
$$f^+(x) = \max\{f(x), 0\} \text{ and } f^-(x) = \max\{-f(x), 0\}$$
and define
$$\int_E f d\mu = \int_E f^+ d\mu - \int_E f^- d\mu.$$
Integration of complex valued functions is simply done by integrating over the real and the imaginary parts separately.

_Def_: We say that $f$ is **integrable** if $\int |f| d\mu < \infty$, and we also put $f \in L^1(\mu)$.

### The Three Big Guns

Of course, we are referring to monotone convergence, Fatou's lemma, and dominated convergence.

**Theorem (Monotone Convergence)**: Let $\{f_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ be a sequence of measurable functions on $X$, and suppose that

1. $0 \leq f_1(x) \leq f_2(x) \leq \cdots \leq \infty$ for all $x \in X$;
2. $f_n(x) \to f(x)$ as $n \to \infty$ pointwise on $X$.

Then $f$ is measurable and
$$\int_X f_n d\mu \to \int_X f d\mu \text{ as } n \to \infty.$$

_Proof_: Let $\alpha = \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_X f_n d\mu$; clearly by construction $\alpha \leq \int_X f d\mu$. Then, for any $0 < c < 1$ and simple function $0 \leq s \leq f$, we define
$$E_n = \{x \mid f_n(x) \geq c s(x) \}$$
which is ascending and has $\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty E_n = X$. Thus, we get
$$\int_X f_n d\mu \geq \int_{E_n} f_n d\mu \geq c \int_{E_n} s d\mu$$
and sending $n \to \infty$ and $c \to 1$ gives
$$\alpha \geq \sup_s \int_X s d\mu = \int_X f d\mu$$
which gives us what we want. $\square$

**Theorem (Fatou's Lemma)**: If $f_n: X \to [0, \infty]$ is measurable for $n \geq 1$, then
$$\int_X \left(\liminf_{n \to \infty} f_n\right) d\mu \leq \liminf_{n \to \infty} \int_X f_n d\mu.$$

_Proof_: Put $g_n(x) = \inf_{m \geq n} f_m(x)$, such that $\liminf_{n \to \infty} f_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} g_n$. Then, we clearly have that by monotone convergence
$$\int_X \left(\liminf_{n \to \infty} f_n\right) d\mu = \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_X g_n d\mu \leq \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_X f_n d\mu = \liminf_{n \to \infty} \int_X f_n d\mu. \ \square$$

**Theorem (Dominated Convergence)**: Suppose $\{f_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is a sequence of measurable functions on $X$, and $f$ satisfies that $f_n \to f$ pointwise on $X$. Then, if there is $g \in L^1(\mu)$ with $|f_n(x)| \leq g(x)$ for all $n$, then $f \in L^1(\mu)$,
$$\int_X |f_n - f| d\mu = 0,$$
and
$$\int_X f_n d\mu \to \int_X f d\mu.$$

_Proof_: Clearly $f \in L^1(\mu)$ since $|f| \leq g$. Moreover, we have that $|f_n - f| \leq 2g$, so Fatou applied to $2g - |f_n - f|$ gives
$$\int_X 2g d\mu \leq \liminf_{n \to \infty} \int_X (2g - |f_n - f|)d\mu = \int_X 2g d\mu - \limsup_{n \to \infty} \int_X |f_n - f|d\mu$$
which gives us that $\int_X |f_n - f| d\mu = 0$. Jensen's inequality then gives 
$$\lim_{n \to \infty}\left|\int_X f_n - \inf_X f\right| \leq \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_X |f_n - f|d\mu = 0. \ \square$$
